# Subjective Tests on Video Game Content

## Motivation

At [Lightflow Media Technologies](https://lightflow.media/) we get to spend one day per month to work on our own projects, it is called Epic Friday. This quarter we decided to explore the video game industry.

These are exciting times! Google just released [Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/), their cloud gaming platform. Facebook has made their move by [buying PlayGiga](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029536/facebook-playgiga-cloud-gaming-acquisition-stadia-xcloud-playstation-now). The story does not end up here, Nvidia has also their on cloud gaming platform: [GeForce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/) and so does [Playstation](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/). The technology behind these is fascinating, and it is undeniable that video is very important for these solutions.

On the side of e-sports, this year has made records on viewers. [League of Legends](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/), by [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en), 2019 World Finals has had a peak of [44 Million viewers and an average per minute of 21 Millions viewers](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/12/2019-world-championship-hits-record-viewership/). This numbers should not be underestimated.

The main idea of this whole project was to play around the concept of very specific content. What we wanted to find out is, for different video games and devices, how did the curve of MOS (Mean Opinion Square) vs Quality behaved. These are [well known curves](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/ssim/) in the industry of video quality metrics. Another key point was to do so with our own metric: the Lightflow Quality Index (LQI) which is used in our [smart encoding solution](https://lightflow.media/). It is a video quality metric that ranges from 100 (perfect quality from source) to 0 (very poor quality)

## Design of the Experiment

Using an integer scale from 1 (bad) to 5 (excelent). We evaluated two video games that have different nature:



* [League of Legends](https://youtu.be/1VjyIsaUGEI?t=699): Isometric third person game, one of the most played e-sports.
* [Shadow of the Tomb Raider](https://youtu.be/JEjx6UbxHTc?t=4407): Third person game, very computer demanding.

We evaluated 9 subjects on two devices:

* PC display: the monitor used was HP 24EA, FHD (1920x1080) with an IPS panel and 23.8". The dimensions were 18,3 x 40,8 x 53,9 cm (DxWxH). The distance to the monitor was of 2xH. The subject's head was centered at the display.
* Mobile phone: the mobile used was a OnePlus 6. It has an AMOLED 2280 x 1080 6.28" display. During the tests it was placed on a comfortable position selected by the subject on a sofa. We considered this test to be very relevant since [35% of Twitch users are on mobile](https://muchneeded.com/twitch-statistics/).

Each subject evaluated 16 fragments of Tomb Raider gameplay and 14 fragments of League of Legends for each device. This was done for 8 and 7 different per game respectively (each quality was evaluated twice). The source video was included in the evaluations and it is represented with an LQI of 100. All the renditions were 1080 except the lowest LQI, which was 720.

The fragments had a length of 10 seconds. The stimuli were spaced by gray frames of 5 seconds of duration. This was done following the recommendations of the [ITU-T P913](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.913/en).

|  LoL |   3.00  |   4.22  |   1.22   |

## Conclusions

1. The first thing to point out is that LQI is highly correlated with the MOS:

|    Test   | Pearson Correlation | P-value |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|:-------:|
|  TR - TV  |         0.94        |   5e-4  |
|  LoL -TV  |         0.93        |   2e-3  |
|  TR - Mob |         0.96        |   1e-4  |
| LoL - Mob |         0.98        |   7e-5  |

*Table of correlations and p-values of the measurements*

2. We can also see saturation of the quality perceived at high video qualities. Specially on League of Legends.
3. The quality perceived on mobile phone curves varies very little.
    * On League of Legends, we can go from **1080@2962Kbps (4 MOS)** to **720@1150Kbps (3 MOS)**.
    * On Tomb Raider, we can go from **1080@10522Kbps (4.8 MOS)** to **720@2695Kbps (3.5 MOS)**. 
4. Since the behavior of the MOS vs the Lightflow Quality Index is (almost) perfectly linear. With a simple model, we are able to predict the quality perceived given a certain video quality for an specific video game on a specific display.
  
|    Test   | R Squared |
|:---------:|:---------:|
|  TR - TV  |    0.88   |
|  LoL -TV  |    0.87   |
|  TR - Mob |    0.93   |
| LoL - Mob |    0.97   |

*Table of [R Squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) values of each linear regression*

5. We can now create a rendition with a **chosen** perceived score on a device and video game, which, using the model, will gives us an LQI that Lightflow will target on the encoding.
6. All the previous translate to bitrate savings. If we were to reduce by **(0.5 - 1 MOS)** the original rendition, we will save up to:

|    Game   | Original BR (Kbps)  **(MOS)** |   TV (Kbps)  **(MOS)**  |
|:---------:|:-----------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|  TR - TV  |       10522  **(4.66)**       | 5795 (-45%)  **(3.66)** |
|  LoL -TV  |        2962  **(4.0)**        |  2060 (-30%)  **(3.3)** |
|  TR - Mob |        10522  **(4.7)**       |  4375 (-58%)  **(3.8)** |
| LoL - Mob |        2962  **(4.22)**       | 2060 (-30%)  **(3.66)** |
